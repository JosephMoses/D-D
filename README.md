# D&D 3.5e Character Generator

##Introduction

I am an avid fan of Dungeons and Dragons and an aspiring Dungeon Master.  Over my years of playing I have come to the realization that the character creation process just takes too long sometimes.  Character creation is a very detailed process that includes rolling up an ability score array, choosing a class and race, assigning ability scores, calculating hit points and saving throws, choosing feats, picking spells or powers (if playing a spellcaster or psionic) and allocating skill points.  Doing all of this can take up a sizeable chunk of time, especially if you do not have an idea of what you want going it.  The idea behind this project was that I wanted something that could be used to take care of most of the character creation process for me in a very short amount of time or when I needed to create a character on the fly.  This application handles ability score generation, race and class selection, ability score assignment and modification based on race and class value, generation of starting hit points, saving throw modifiers, and skill points, and will even generate a name for the character.  I have included every race and class I could find in the books as well as the option to use homemade classes and races to allow for maximum diversity.

##Instructions

**NOTE: Both .py files must be saved into the same folder for this application to work correctly.**
-Once the application is launched it will prompt the user with a series of yes or no questions.  To respond to a question with yes, simply enter a y (non case sensitive) then press enter.  Doing anything else will be treated as a no.  **When prompted about using Homebrew (homemade) races or classes you will have to have first ran the HomebrewInstaller.py file**
